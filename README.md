## INTRODUCTION

AtliQ Grands, a reputed chain of five-star hotels across India, has been experiencing a decline in market share and revenue due to increased competition and lack of data-driven decisions.

In an effort to revitalize their revenue strategy, the management decided to incorporate Business and Data Intelligence practices. 

As they did not have an in-house analytics team, they outsourced the task of data analysis to generate actionable insights from historical data.

This project presents a comprehensive analysis aimed at helping the Revenue Management Team of AtliQ Grands make informed strategic decisions to regain their competitive edge.
